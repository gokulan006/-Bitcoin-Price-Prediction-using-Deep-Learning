# **BitPredict ðŸ’°ðŸ“ˆ - Bitcoin Price Prediction using Deep Learning**
**ðŸ“Œ Overview**

This project focuses on time series forecasting for Bitcoin price prediction using deep learning models. The goal is to analyze historical Bitcoin price data and build models that can predict future price movements.

**ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow**

1.Data Collection

  - Historical Bitcoin price data is loaded using Pandas and Python's CSV module.
    
2.Data Preparation

 - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
 - Visualizing time series data.
   
 - Transforming data into a supervised learning problem (windowing).
 
 - Preparing both univariate and multivariate datasets.
   
3.Modeling Experiments

 - Baseline (NaÃ¯ve Model)
 
 - Dense (Fully Connected) Networks
 - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks
 - 1D CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
 - N-BEATS Algorithm
 - Multivariate Models
 - Ensemble Models (Combining multiple models)
 - Future Prediction Model
   





4.Model Evaluation & Forecasting
 - Using various performance metrics to evaluate models.
 - Saving the best-performing model using model checkpoints.
 - Making predictions and creating confidence intervals for forecasts.




ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
 - Python
 - Pandas, NumPy
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
 - TensorFlow, Keras (for deep learning)
 - LSTMs, CNNs, N-BEATS (for time series forecasting)
